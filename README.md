# Git Lesson

This lesson covers the basics of git for version control.

This lesson is for the first day of the MSSE bootcamp (CHEM 280).

To make a commit of your files, follow this procedure:
1.  Make changes to your project that you would like to keep.
When you have your changes, tell `git` you are ready to create a checkpoint of the file using the `git add FILENAME` command.
3. Create a checkpoint of your file using `git commit -, "Message about what  you did"`
